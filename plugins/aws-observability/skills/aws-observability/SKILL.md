# AWS Observability

Requires AWS CLI credentials. All stdio MCP servers use `AWS_PROFILE` and `AWS_REGION` from their env config (defaults: `default` profile, `us-east-1`).

## Capabilities

| Capability                  | MCP Server                                         | Use When                                                 |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| CloudWatch Logs             | `awslabs.cloudwatch-mcp-server`                    | Log queries, pattern detection, anomaly analysis         |
| Metrics & Alarms            | `awslabs.cloudwatch-mcp-server`                    | Metric data, alarm recommendations, trend analysis       |
| Application Signals (APM)   | `awslabs.cloudwatch-applicationsignals-mcp-server` | Service health, SLOs, distributed tracing, error budgets |
| CloudTrail Security         | `awslabs.cloudtrail-mcp-server`                    | IAM changes, resource deletions, compliance audits       |
| Billing & Cost Management   | `awslabs.billing-cost-management-mcp-server`       | Cost analysis, forecasting, Compute Optimizer, budgets   |
| AWS Documentation           | `awsknowledge` (HTTP)                              | Troubleshooting, best practices, API references          |
| Codebase Observability Gaps | _(file analysis, no MCP)_                          | Identify missing logging, metrics, tracing in code       |

## Workflow Decision Tree

**User reports an incident or error?**
-> Load [Incident Response](references/incident-response.md). Start with `audit_services` wildcard, then correlate alarms + logs + traces + CloudTrail changes.

**User asks about logs or wants to query logs?**
-> Load [Log Analysis](references/log-analysis.md). Use `execute_log_insights_query`. Always include `| limit` in queries.

**User wants to set up or tune alarms?**
-> Load [Alerting Setup](references/alerting-setup.md). Use `get_recommended_metric_alarms` for best-practice thresholds.

**User asks about service performance, latency, or SLOs?**
-> Load [Performance Monitoring](references/performance-monitoring.md). Start with `audit_services`, then `search_transaction_spans` for 100% trace visibility.

**User needs security audit or compliance review?**
-> Load [Security Auditing](references/security-auditing.md). Follow data source priority: CloudTrail Lake > CloudWatch Logs > Lookup Events API.

**User wants to assess codebase observability?**
-> Load [Observability Gap Analysis](references/observability-gap-analysis.md). Analyze logging, metrics, tracing, error handling, health checks.

**User setting up Application Signals for the first time?**
-> Load [Application Signals Setup](references/application-signals-setup.md). Start with `get_enablement_guide`.

**CloudTrail data source priority reference** (loaded by security-auditing.md, not directly):
-> [CloudTrail Data Source Selection](references/cloudtrail-data-source-selection.md)

## Essential Log Query Patterns

### Error Search

```
fields @timestamp, @message, @logStream, level
| filter level = "ERROR"
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 100
```

### Performance Analysis

```
stats count() as requestCount,
      avg(duration) as avgDuration,
      pct(duration, 95) as p95Duration,
      pct(duration, 99) as p99Duration
by endpoint
| filter requestCount > 10
| sort p95Duration desc
| limit 100
```

### Error Rate Over Time

```
stats count() as total,
      sum(statusCode >= 500) as errors,
      (sum(statusCode >= 500) / count()) * 100 as errorRate
by bin(5m) as timeWindow
| sort timeWindow
```

## Key Tool Entry Points

- **Application Signals**: Start with `audit_services` using `[{"Type":"service","Data":{"Service":{"Type":"Service","Name":"*"}}}]` for wildcard discovery
- **Logs**: Use `describe_log_groups` to discover groups, then `execute_log_insights_query`
- **Metrics**: Use Sum for count metrics, Average for utilization, percentiles for latency
- **CloudTrail**: Check Lake first (`list_event_data_stores`), fall back to CloudWatch Logs, then `lookup_events`
- **Costs**: Use `cost-explorer` tool for spend analysis, `compute-optimizer` for right-sizing
